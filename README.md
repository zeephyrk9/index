Scraping, parsing, storing and distributing furry content over the web with always-free and near-limitless api

## TODOs

- [ ] Rewrite e621's Reconciler to store post information in redis instead of plain-old JavaScript objects
- [ ] Add more reconcilers and scrappers
    - [ ] FurAffinity reconciler* and scraper
    - [ ] SoFurry reconciler* and scraper
    - [ ] 

    _*_ This reconciler will be much harder to do, considering that this website doesn't provide some magical thingie like e621's database export archive.
- [ ] Investigate the possibility of adding these reconcilers and scrapers:
    - [ ] DeviantArt
    - [ ] ArchiveOfOurOwn
    - [ ] FurryNetwork
    - [ ] r/furry_irl _(or other furry-related reddit source)_
    - [ ] Twitter?
    - [ ] Weasyl
    - [ ] InkBunny
